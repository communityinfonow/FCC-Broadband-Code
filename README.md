# FCC-Broadband-Code
This repository contains R code for analyzing FCC Broadband data to calculate the percent of address locations with broadband internet access by census tract, zip code, city, and county. Specifically, this code shows how this indicator was calculated for Bexar County, Texas. 

In total, this repository includes multiple files: 1) the R code necessary to calculate the percent of address locations with broadband internet access; 2) The list of zip codes used to calculate the indicator by zip code for Bexar County; 3) the list of Block IDs specific to San Antonio to be able to calculate this indicator for San Antonio; and 4) the file to crosswalk the zip code and block IDs.

To run this code for your own County, City, zip codes, and Census tracts, you will need to download the free files from the FCC national broadband map site (https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home) in .csv format and create your own list of zip codes, list of block IDs specific to your city, and your own crosswalk between zip codes and block IDs.
